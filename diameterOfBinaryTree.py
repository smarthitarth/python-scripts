Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
Approach #1: Depth-First Search [Accepted]
Intuition

Any path can be written as two arrows (in different directions) from some node, where an arrow is a path that starts at some node and only travels down to child nodes.

If we knew the maximum length arrows L, R for each child, then the best path touches L + R + 1 nodes.

Algorithm

Let's calculate the depth of a node in the usual way: max(depth of node.left, depth of node.right) + 1. While we do, a path "through" this node uses 1 + (depth of node.left) + (depth of node.right) nodes. Let's search each node and remember the highest number of nodes used in some path. The desired length is 1 minus this number.

class Solution {
    int ans;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        ans = 1;
        depth(root);
        return ans - 1;
    }
    public int depth(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int L = depth(node.left);
        int R = depth(node.right);
        ans = Math.max(ans, L+R+1);
        return Math.max(L, R) + 1;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)O(N). We visit every node once.

Space Complexity: O(N)O(N), the size of our implicit call stack during our depth-first search.
Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
